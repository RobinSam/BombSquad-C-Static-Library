All operator overload files should be named with ".cpp"

Remember to declare scope for operator overload files
ex: "Complex Complex:: operator +(Complex& lhs, Complex&rhs)"

Also, both arguments for operator overloading should be references "&".

How to compile the library (make sure to exclude the ComplexRunner.o):
ar rsv complexLibrary.a *.o
